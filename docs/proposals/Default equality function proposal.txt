[proposal] default func ==(_:_:)

Feature name - provide default func ==(_:_:) for types declared Equatable

Author: Jan E.Schotsman

Introduction:

If all of a type's stored properties are Equatable it makes sense for Swift to provide a default equality implementation.

Motivation:

In a project where many large types are defined that need to be Equatable it gets cumbersome to write explicit equality functions for all types.

Proposed solution

If a type is declared Equatable, all its stored properties are Equatable and no func ==(_:_:) is defined by the developer the compiler will synthetisize a memberwise equality function.
(Recursiveness of this procedure is almost automatic)

Impact on existing code

There is no impact on existing code. Equality functions equal to the default implementation can simply be removed.
