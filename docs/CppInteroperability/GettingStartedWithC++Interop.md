## Installing Toolchain 

For ensuring the availability of the features we used in this demo. Please install the latest version of the toolchain from "Development Snapshots" on [swift.org](https://www.swift.org/download/#snapshots).

After finishing installing, go to the Xcode menu, select Xcode | Toolchains, and pick the latest toolchain.

## Creating a Module to contain your C++ source code

- Create a new Xcode project.
- Create a new target in Xcode via _File_ | _New_ | _Target_, select _Library_.
- Inside the project folder, create a new C++ implementation and header file. 
- For this example we will call the files CxxTest, so we should have a CxxTest.cpp and CxxTest.hpp. Source code listed at the end of this section.
- Change the "Target Membership" setting, hpp file should set the target to the library target, and cpp file should be set to both the project and library target. 
- Next create an empty file and call it `module.modulemap`, in this file create the module for your source code, and define your C++ header (`requires cplusplus` isn't required but it's convention for C++ modules, especially if they use C++ features). Source code listed at the end of this section.

The file structure of the demo Xcode project:
```
├ PROJECT_NAME
├── CxxTest
│   ├── CxxTest.cpp
│   ├── CxxTest.hpp
│   └── module.modulemap
├── PROJECT_NAME
│   └── main.swift
```

Source code:
```
// In module.modulemap

module CxxTest {
    header "CxxTest.hpp"
    requires cplusplus
}
```

```
// In CxxTest.hpp

#ifndef CxxTest_hpp
#define CxxTest_hpp

int cxxFunction(int n);

#endif
```

```
// In CxxTest.cpp

#include "CxxTest.hpp"

int cxxFunction(int n) {
    return n;
}
```

```
// In main.swift

import Foundation
import CxxTest

print("Hello, World! \(cxxFunction(7))")

```

## Adding C++ to an Xcode project
In your Xcode project, follow the steps [Creating a Module to contain your C++ source code](#creating-a-module-to-contain-your-c-source-code) in your project directory.

Add the C++ module to the include path and enable C++ interop:
- Navigate to your project directory.
- In `Project` navigate to `Build Settings` -> `Swift Compiler`.
- Under `Custom Flags` -> `Other Swift Flags` add`-Xfrontend-enable-experimental-cxx-interop`. If you cannot find `Other Swift Flags`, please ensure all build settings have been shown.
- Under `Swift Compiler - Search Paths` -> `Import Paths` add your search path to the C++ module (i.e, `$(SRCROOT)/CxxTest`). 

This should now allow you to import your C++ Module into the `main.swift` file.

## Creating a Swift Package
After creating your Swift package project, follow the steps [Creating a Module to contain your C++ source code](#creating-a-module-to-contain-your-c-source-code) in your `Source` directory.

- In your Package Manifest, you need to configure the Swift target's dependencies and compiler flags.
- In this example the name of the package is `CxxInterop`.
- Swift code will be in `Sources/CxxInterop` called `main.swift`.
- C++ source code follows the example shown in [Creating a Module to contain your C++ source code](#creating-a-module-to-contain-your-c-source-code).
- In `Package.swift` file inside the project, under targets, add the name of your C++ module and the directory containing the Swift code as a target.
- In the target defining your Swift target, add a`dependencies` to the C++ Module, the `path`, `source`, and `swiftSettings` with `unsafeFlags` with the source to the C++ Module, and enable `-enable-experimental-cxx-interop`.

```
//In Package Manifest

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "CxxInterop",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v12)],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "CxxTest",
            targets: ["CxxTest"]),
        .library(
            name: "CxxInterop",
            targets: ["CxxInterop"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "CxxTest",
            dependencies: []
        ),
        .executableTarget(
            name: "CxxInterop",
            dependencies: ["CxxTest"],
            path: "./Sources/CxxInterop",
            sources: [ "main.swift" ],
            swiftSettings: [.unsafeFlags([
                "-I", "Sources/CxxTest",
                "-enable-experimental-cxx-interop",
            ])]
        ),
    ]
)

```

- We are now able to import our C++ Module into our swift code, and import the package into existing projects

```
//In main.swift

import CxxTest

public struct CxxInterop {

    public func callCxxFunction(n: Int32) -> Int32 {
        return cxxFunction(n: n)
    }
}

print(CxxInterop().callCxxFunction(n: 7))
//outputs: 7

```

## Building with CMake
After creating your project follow the steps [Creating a Module to contain your C++ source code](#creating-a-module-to-contain-your-c-source-code).

- Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file and configure for your project.
- In`add_library` invoke `cxx-support` with the path to the C++ implementation file.
- Add the `target_include_directories` with `cxx-support` and path to the C++ Module `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Sources/CxxTest`.
- Add the `add_executable` to the specific files/directory you would like to generate source, with`SHELL:-enable-experimental-cxx-interop`.
- In the example below we will be following the file structure used in [Creating a Swift Package](#Creating-a-Swift-Package).

```
// In CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

project(CxxInterop LANGUAGES CXX Swift)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED YES)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

add_library(cxx-support ./Sources/CxxTest/CxxTest.cpp)
target_compile_options(cxx-support PRIVATE
  -fno-exceptions
  -fignore-exceptions)
target_include_directories(cxx-support PUBLIC
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Sources/CxxTest)

add_executable(CxxInterop ./Sources/CxxInterop/main.swift)
target_compile_options(CxxInterop PRIVATE
  "SHELL:-enable-experimental-cxx-interop"
target_link_libraries(CxxInterop PRIVATE cxx-support)

```

```
//In main.swift

import CxxTest

public struct CxxInterop {
    public static func main() {
        let result = cxxFunction(7)
        print(result)
    }
}

CxxInterop.main()

```

- In your project's directory, run `cmake` to generate the systems build files.

- To generate an Xcode project run `cmake -GXcode`.
- To generate with Ninja run `cmake -GNinja`.

- For more information on `cmake` see the  'GettingStarted' documentation: (https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/HowToGuides/GettingStarted.md).

## Common Errors
- No such module 'CxxTest'.
It is probably because Xcode cannot find the C++ module via the "Import Paths" you set in [Adding C++ to an Xcode project](#adding-c-to-an-xcode-project).

- Undefined symbol: cxxFunction(int).
1. Check the Target Membership setting, hpp file should set the target to the library target, and cpp file should be set to both the project and library target. 
2. If you drag the CxxTest folder into the Xcode project manually and set it as a `folder reference`. Please re-import it as a `group` instead. And then change hpp & cpp files' target settings respectively.
