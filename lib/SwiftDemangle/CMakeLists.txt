# Do not enforce checks for LLVM's ABI-breaking build settings.
# The demangler uses some header-only code from LLVM's ADT classes,
# but we do not want to link libSupport into the demangler. These checks rely
# on the presence of symbols in libSupport to identify how the code was
# built and cause link failures for mismatches. Without linking that library,
# we get link failures regardless, so instead, this just disables the checks.
