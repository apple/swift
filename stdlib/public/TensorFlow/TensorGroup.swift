/// A protocol for types that can be used as tensor operation inputs and
/// outputs. When a TensorGroup is used as an input, it gets passed to the
/// tensor operation as an input list whose elements are the tensor fields of
/// the type. When a TensorGroup is used as an output, it gets initialized
/// with its tensor fields set to the tensor operation's tensor outputs.

/// to write the conformance themselves.
